    "*This notebook provides a structured roadmap for analyzing video datasets. It guides you step-by-step through setup, loading, cleaning, temporal/spatial preprocessing, exploratory analysis, augmentation, and evaluation. Students can follow these stages to prepare and analyze video data for tasks such as classification, action recognition, detection, tracking, segmentation, and captioning.*\n",
